# PLS – Private Label Store Manager

This plugin is a scaffold for a private-label WooCommerce store that is built with **Hello Elementor + Elementor Pro**.

It provides:

1. **Products & Packs**: Manage base products + pack tiers and sync to Woo variable products/variations.
2. **Attributes & Swatches**: Central attribute/value library + visual swatches + optional SEO metadata.
3. **Bundles & Deals**: Define business-line bundles and show upgrade offers on the front end.

## Key design rule
Elementor should render **native WooCommerce objects**:
- variable products
- variations
- global attributes + terms

So the Theme Builder templates and Woo widgets work without hacks.

## Version
0.1.0 (2025-12-06) – scaffold with DB tables + Elementor widgets (stub UI) + AJAX placeholders.
