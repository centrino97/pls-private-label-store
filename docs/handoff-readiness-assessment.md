## 📋 What to Tell Robert & Raniya

### If Handing Off Now:
> "The system is fully functional and ready for you to start adding products. You can create products, set up pack tiers, configure options, and customers can place orders. The frontend is working well, though we have some advanced features planned for the next version (v4.9.99) that will enhance conversion rates. For now, everything you need to start selling is in place."

### If Completing v4.9.99 First:
> "We're finishing up some advanced frontend enhancements to optimize conversion rates. Once complete, you'll have tier-based ingredient unlocking, inline configurators throughout product pages, and multiple CTAs for better conversion. Should be ready in 1-2 days."
