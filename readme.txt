A scaffold plugin for a private-label WooCommerce store built with Hello Elementor + Elementor Pro.

and provides Elementor widgets as placeholders for a seamless Theme Builder integration.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the ZIP in WP Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
2. Activate
3. Configure under WooCommerce → Private Label (PLS)

== Notes ==
This version is a scaffold (Phase 0). Your dev team will implement full CRUD and the sync engine.
